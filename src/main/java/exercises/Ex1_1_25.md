gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r)   
Proof:  
Let d = gcd(a, b). Then d | a and d | b. (Definition of gcd)  
Since a = bq + r and d divides both a and b we must have that d | r.  
Thus d | b and d | r. It remains to show that d is the largest such integer.  
We know that if d | b and d | r then d | (bq + r).  
Thus every common divisor of b and r is also a common divisor of a and b.  
But d is the largest common divisor of a and b (by definition of d), thus it must also be the largest  
divisor of b and r.
