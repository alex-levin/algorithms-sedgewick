1.1.25 Use mathematical induction to prove that Euclid’s algorithm computes the
greatest common divisor of any pair of non-negative integers p and q.

p = dq + r
Let's prove that gcd(p, q) = gcd(q, r)
Let m = gcd(p, q) and n = gcd(q, r)
First, we will prove that m also divides both q and r.
If this is the case, m would be <= gcd(q, r) because n = gcd(q, r).
m divides p and m divides q:
p = ma and q = mb
r = p - dq
r = ma - mbq
r = m(a - bq)
This means m divides r.
Since m divides q and m divides r, m <= gcd(q, r).
On another hand, n divides q and n divides r:
q = nx and r = ny
Since p = dq + r, n also divides p:
p = dnx + ny = n(dx + y)
So n divides p and n divides q.
Hence, n <= gcd(p, q) because m = gcd(p, q).
We got m <= n and n <= m.
Hence, m = n and gcd(p, q) = gcd(q, r).
